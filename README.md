# Cisco Postman Collections

This purpose of this repository is to provide Postman collections
for the REST API of different Cisco related solutions. Getting
up to scratch with various APIs can be a daunting task at first,
which is why I decided to create this project and provide ready-to-use
API calls to test API functions

## Structure

The repository is organized by products. Each directory includes the
corresponding Postman collection and a README file describing how 
to use the collection
